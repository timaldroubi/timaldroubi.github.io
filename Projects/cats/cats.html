        <pre class="small">Tools: HTML, CSS, JS      Dates: 2024</pre>

        <p>This website design draft was created for a Web Design Class. For this project I was tasked with creating a single page website design showing a timeline over a topic of my choosing relating to the internet. The topic I chose was the history of cats on the internet and I tried to keep the design fun and playful.</p>
